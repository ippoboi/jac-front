# Junior ISEP Acedemy Mobile APP 2022 Project

## What is this project about ?

This app was this year's JAC project. Junior ISEP Academy, created and managed by the Junior Entreprise of the ISEP engineering school, trains students of the school in mobile application development technologies through a defined annual project which aims to increase the skills of ISEP students.
